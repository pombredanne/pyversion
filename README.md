#### pyversion


`pyversion` is a Python 3 version comparison library based on [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) principles.
It's a fork of [`semver`](https://github.com/marekjm/semver) library I wrote.
The reason for the fork was the need to support non-standard version strings like `256` or `4.2.5.6` and
so the name `semver` was not really accurate.
